### Planning Problems
1. Solution doesn't solve the problem
2. Solution is too complex or expensive
3. Can't explain how it works

### Experimentation Issues
1. Too many approaches tested for too long
2. Unreproducible results
3. Over-engineered complexity

### Deployment Issues
1. Scalability (money or time) problems
2. Failure to meet service-level agreement
3. Inadequate code tests

### Scoping Problems
1. Solution takes too long to develop
2. Problem complexity underestimated
3. Insufficient time for skills acquisition

### Development Issues
1. Unstable, fragile, or non-performant code
2. Late-stage implementation change

### Evaluation Issues
1. High cost vs value of solution
2. Drift causing instability
3. Can't explain solution value
