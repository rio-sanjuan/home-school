## Definitions

1. $f(n) = O(g(n))$ means $c\cdot g(n)$ is an *upper bound* on $f(n)$. Thus, there exists some constant $c$ such that $f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$ for every large enough $n$ (that is, for all $n\geq n_0$, for some constant $n_0$).
2. $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ means $c\cdot g(n)$ is a *lower bound* on $f(n)$. Thus, there exists some constant $c$ such that $f(n) \geq c \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.
