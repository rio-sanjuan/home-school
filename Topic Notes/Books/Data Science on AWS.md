# Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Science on AWS

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

* Agility
	* Spin up resources as needed
* Cost Savings
	* Trade capital expenses for variable expenses
* Elasticity
	* Automatically scale resources up or down to match needs
* Innovate Faster
	* Allows us to focus on developing applications that differentiate our business, rather than the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing infrastructure.
* Deploy Globally in Minutes
	* *Region* is a physical location around the world where data centers are clustered. *Availability Zones* is a group of logical data centers. Each *Region* contains multiple, isolated, and physically separate *Availability Zones* within a geographic area.
* Smooth Transition from Prototype to Production

## Data Science Pipelines and Workflows

*Data Preparation*
Data Ingestion >> Data Analysis >> Data Transformation >> Data Validation >> Create Training Data >>

*Model Training and Tuning*
Model Training >> Model Tuning >>

*Deployment and Monitoring*
Deployment >> Serving >> Monitoring >> Logging
