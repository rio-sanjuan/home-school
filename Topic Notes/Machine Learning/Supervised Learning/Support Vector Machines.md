A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is well-known for its effectiveness in classification problems and its ability to handle high-dimensional data. SVMs work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes in a feature space.

An SVM works by first aiming to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin (distance) between the nearest data points of the two classes, known as support vectors. A hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates data points into different classes. Support vectors are the data points closest to the hyperplane. They play a critical role in defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. SVMs maximize this margin to improve the model's generalization ability, i.e. it attempts to solve the following optimization problem:
1. Maximize: $\frac 12 \vert\vert w\vert\vert^2$ 
2. Subject to:  $y_i(w\cdot x_i + b) \geq 1, \forall i$ 
### Advantages of SVM
1. **Effective in high-dimensional spaces**: SVM works well for datasets with many features
2. **Robust to overfitting**: especially when the number of features is greater than the number of samples
3. **Versatility**: with kernel functions, SVMs can handle linear and non-linear classification problems
### Disadvantages of SVM
1. **Computational Complexity**: training and can be slow for large datasets due to quadratic optimization
2. **Choice of Kernel**: performance heavily depends on the appropriate kernel and hyperparameter tuning
3. **Not ideal for large datasets**: SVM scales poorly with the number of samples
4. **Difficult interpretation**: unlike decision trees, SVM models are not inherently interpretable
## Kernel Trick

The kernel trick allows SVMs to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicitly computing the transformations. Common kernels include:
1. **Linear kernel**: for linearly separable data, $K(x_i,x_j) = x_i\cdot x_j$
2. **Polynomial kernel**: for more complex boundaries, $K(x_i,x_j) = (x_i\cdot x_j + c)^d$
3. **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel**: popular for non-linear problems, $K(x_i,x_j) = \exp(-\gamma\vert\vert x_i-x_j\vert\vert^2)$ 
4. **Sigmoid Kernel**: similar to neural networks, $K(x_i,x_j) = \tanh(\alpha x_i\cdot x_j + c)$ 
## Soft Margin SVM

Real-world data often contains noise or overlaps between classes. To handle this, SVM introduces a *soft margin* that allows some misclassifications. The $C$ parameter controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors:
1. **High C**: Focuses on minimizing the classification errors, leading to a smaller margin
2. **Low C**: Focuses on maximizing the margin, tolerating more misclassifications
