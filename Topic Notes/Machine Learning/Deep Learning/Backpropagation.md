Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is a fundamental algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. It plays a crucial role in enabling these networks to learn from data by adjusting their internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the difference between their predictions and the actual outcomes. 

The primary goal of backpropagation is to optimize the neural network's performance by minimizing a loss (or cost) function. The loss function quantifies the discrepancy between the network's predictions and the true target values. By minimizing the loss, the network becomes better at making accurate predictions.

## Forward Pass

During the forward pass, the input data is fed into the neural network. Each neuron process the input by applying weights, adding biases, and passing the result through an activation function. During the forward pass, the network computes the output based on current weights and biases, and the loss function evaluates the prediction's accuracy.
## Backward Pass

During the backward pass, the loss is computed by comparing the network's prediction with the actual target. Using calculus, specifically
