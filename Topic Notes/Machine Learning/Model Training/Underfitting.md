Underfitting is the opposite of [[Overfitting]]: it occurs when your model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data.
## Solutions
1. Select a more powerful model, with more parameters
2. Feed better features to the learning algorithm (feature engineering)
3. Reduce the constraints on the model (e.g., reduce the [[Regularization]] hyperparameters)
