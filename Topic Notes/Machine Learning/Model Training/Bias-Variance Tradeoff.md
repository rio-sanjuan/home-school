The Bias-Variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the tradeoffs between two types of error when building models:

1. **Bias** refers to the error caused by applying a simplistic model to a complex dataset. Models with high bias are too simple and lead to [[Underfitting]] the data, failing to capture important patterns. An example would be applying a linear regression model to a dataset with non-linear dynamics.
2. **Variance** refers to the error caused by applying an overly complex model to a simple dataset, finding signal in the noise. Models with high variance are too complex and lead to [[Overfitting]] the data, failing to generalize well to unseen examples. An example would be a [[Decision Tree]] without restrictions that "memorizes" all of the training points.

Adding complexity to a high-bias model can increase variance, and simplifying a high-variance model can introduce bias. The best model has a tradeoff of both, with enough complexity to capture the dynamics in the dataset, while still generalizing well to data that it wasn't trained on.
## Solutions
1. Choose an appropriate level of model complexity
2. Use [[Regularization]] techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting.
3. Use more data to reduce variance without increasing bias
4. Use ensemble methods (e.g., [[Bagging]], [[Boosting]]) to reduce variance
