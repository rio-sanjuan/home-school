Residual Standard Error (RSE) is a measure of the variability of the residuals (error) in a [[Linear Regression]] model. It quantifies the typical size of the residuals, providing insight into how well the model fits the data. RSE tells you how far the observed data points are, on average, from the regression line.$$\text{RSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{RSS}}{n-p}}$$where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model and $\text{RSS}$ is the Residual Sum of Squares$$\text{RSS}=\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\hat y_i)^2.$$RSE is con
