The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is the the ratio of variance of $\hat\beta_i$ when fitting the full model divided by the variance of $\hat\beta_i$ if fit on its own. The smallest possible value for VIF is 1, which indicates the complete absence of [[Linear Regression#Collinearity]]. As a rule of thumb, a VIF value that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity among the predictors.
