In many real-world graphs, there are often features or attributes associated with the nodes. This kind of graph structured data can be viewed as graph signals, which capture both the structure information (or connectivity between nodes) and data(or attributes at nodes). A graph signal consists of a graph $\mathcal{G}=\{\mathcal{V,E}\}$ and a mapping function $f$ defined on the node domain, which maps the nodes to real values. Mathematically, the mapping function can be represented as $$f : \mathcal{V}\to\mathbb{R}^d$$where $d$ is the dimension of the value (vector) associated with each node.
