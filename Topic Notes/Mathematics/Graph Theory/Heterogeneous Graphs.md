In many real-world applications, we want to model multiple types of relations between multiple types of nodes. A heterogeneous graph $\mathcal{G}$ consists of a set of nodes $\mathcal{V}=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{N_v}\}$ and a set of edges $\mathcal{E} = \{e_1,\ldots,e_{N_e}\}$ where each node and each edge are associated with a type. Let $\mathcal{T}_n$ denote the set of node types and $\mathcal{T}_e$ indicate the set of edge types. There are two mapping function $\phi_n:\mathcal{V}\to\mathcal{T}_n$ and $\phi_e:\mathcal{V}\to\mathcal{T}_e$ that map each node and each edge to their types, respectively.
