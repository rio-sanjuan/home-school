In many real-world graphs, multiple relations can simultaneously exist between a pair of nodes. A multidimensional graph consists of a set of $N$ nodes $V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_N\}$ and $D$ sets of edges $\{E_1,\ldots,E_D\}$. Each edge set $E_d$ describes the $d^{th}$ type of relation between the nodes in the corresponding $d^{th}$ dimension. These $D$ types of relations can also be expressed by $D$ adjacency matrices $A^{(1)},\ldots,A^{(D)}$. In the dimension $d$, its corresponding adjacency matrix $A_d\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ describes the edges $E_d$ between nodes in $V$. Specifically, the $i,j^{th}$ element of $A_d$, denoted as $A_d[i,j]$, equals 1 only when there is an edge between. nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$ in the dimension $d$ (or $(v_i,v_j)\in E_d$) and otherwise is 0.
