In many real-world applications, relations are beyond pairwise associations. Compared with edges in simpler graphs, hyperedges can encode higher-order relations. The graphs with hyperedges are called hypergraphs. Let $G = \{V,E,W\}$ be a hypergraph, where $V$ is a set of $N$ nodes, $E$ is a set of hyperedges, and $W\in\mathbb{R}^{|E|\times|E|}$ is a diagonal matrix with $W[j,j]$ denoting the weight of the hyperedge $e_j$. The hypergraph $G$ can be described by an incidence matrix $H\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|\times|E|}$, where $H_{i,j}=1$ only when the node $v_i$ is incident to the edge $e_j$. For a vertex $v_i$, its degree is defined as $d(v_i)=\sum_{j=1}^{|E|}H_{i,j}$, and the degree for a hyperedge is defined as $d(e_j) =\sum_{i=1}^{|V|}H_{i,j}$. Furthermore, we use $D_e$ and $D_v$ to denote the diagonal matrices of the edge and vertex degrees, respectively.
