In a graph, the centrality of a node measures the importance of the node in the graph. There are different ways to measure the importance.
## Degree Centrality
Intuitively, a node can be considered important if there are many other nodes connected to it. Hence, we can measure the centrality of a given node based on its [[Definitions#Degree]]. In particular, for node $v_i$, its degree centrality can be defined as $c_d(v_i) = d(v_i)$.
## Eigenvector Centrality
Though degree-based centrality considers a node with many neighbors as important, it treats all neighbors equally. However, the neighbors themselves can have different importance; thus, they could affect the importance of the central node differently. The *eigenvector centrality* defines a centrality score of a given node $v_i$ by considering the centrality scores of its neighboring nodes as $$c_e(v_i) = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{j=1}^N\textbf{A}_{i,j}\cdot c_e(v_j),$$ which can be rewritten in matrix form as $$\textbf{c}_e = \frac1\lambda\textbf{Ac}_e$$where $\textbf{c}_e\in\mathbb{R}^N$ is a vector containing the centrality scores of all nodes in the graph. Clearly $\textbf{c}_e$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\textbf{A}$ with its corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$. However, given an adjacency matrix $\textbf{A}$, there exist multiple pairs of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Usually, we want the centrality scores to be positive. Hence, we wish to choose an eigenvector with all positive elements. According to the [[Perron-Frobenius Theorem]], a real squared matrix with positive elements has a unique largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector has all positive elements. Thus, we can choose $\lambda$ as the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector as the centrality score vector.
## Katz Centrality
Katz centrality is a variant of eigencentrality, which not only considers the centrality scores of the neighbors but also includes a small constant for the central node itself. Specifically, the Katz centrality for a node $v_i$ can be defined as: $$c_k(v_i) = \alpha\sum_{j=1}^N\textbf{A}_{i,j}c_k(v_j)+\beta,$$ where $\beta$ is a constant. The Katz centrality
