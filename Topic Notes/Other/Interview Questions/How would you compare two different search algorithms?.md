# How would you compare the results of two different search algorithms?

Comparing two different search algorithms typically involves evaluating them based on several criteria, such as relevance, efficiency, and accuracy. When incorporating rankings of the results, you may consider additional metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Precision@K. Below is a general approach to compare two search algorithms:

### 1. **Define Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Relevance:** Assess if the returned results are relevant to the search query.
- **Efficiency:** Measure the time and resources consumed by each algorithm.
- **Accuracy:** Evaluate the accuracy of the algorithms in retrieving the correct documents.
- **Precision@K:** Measure the proportion of relevant results in the top K results.
- **Recall:** Assess the ability of the algorithm to retrieve all relevant results.
- **NDCG:** Evaluate the ranking quality of the search results, taking into account the positions of the relevant documents.

### 2. **Collect Datasets:**

- **Query Dataset:** Have a collection of search queries.
- **Ground Truth Dataset:** Have a set of ground truth relevant documents for each query.

### 3. **Run Experiments:**

- Execute both search algorithms on the query dataset.
- Collect the search results and measure the evaluation metrics for each algorithm.

### 4. **Incorporate Rankings:**

- **Precision@K:** Evaluate the precision of the algorithms at different cut-off points (e.g., top-1, top-5, top-10).
- **NDCG:** Evaluate the quality of the rankings produced by the algorithms, giving higher weights to relevant documents at higher ranks.

### 5. **Statistical Analysis:**

- Apply statistical tests to determine if the observed differences in the metrics are statistically significant.

### 6. **Analysis of Results:**

- Compare the results based on the defined metrics.
- Analyze any trade-offs between the algorithms, such as precision vs. recall, or relevance vs. efficiency.

### Example:

Letâ€™s say we have two search algorithms, A and B, and we want to compare their performance using Precision@5 and NDCG.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score, precision_score

def evaluate_algorithms(queries, ground_truth, algo_a, algo_b):
    ndcg_a, ndcg_b = [], []
    precision_at_5_a, precision_at_5_b = [], []

    for query, true_docs in zip(queries, ground_truth):
        results_a = algo_a.search(query)
        results_b = algo_b.search(query)

        # Assuming binary relevance (relevant or not relevant)
        rel_a = np.array([1 if doc in true_docs else 0 for doc in results_a])
        rel_b = np.array([1 if doc in true_docs else 0 for doc in results_b])

        # NDCG
        ndcg_a.append(ndcg_score([true_docs], [rel_a]))
        ndcg_b.append(ndcg_score([true_docs], [rel_b]))

        # Precision@5
        precision_at_5_a.append(precision_score(true_docs, rel_a[:5], average='binary'))
        precision_at_5_b.append(precision_score(true_docs, rel_b[:5], average='binary'))

    print(f"Algorithm A - Avg NDCG: {np.mean(ndcg_a)}, Avg Precision@5: {np.mean(precision_at_5_a)}")
    print(f"Algorithm B - Avg NDCG: {np.mean(ndcg_b)}, Avg Precision@5: {np.mean(precision_at_5_b)}")

# Replace with actual queries, ground truth, and algorithm instances
queries = ["Example Query 1", "Example Query 2"]
ground_truth = [["doc1", "doc3"], ["doc2", "doc4"]]
algo_a = AlgorithmA()
algo_b = AlgorithmB()

evaluate_algorithms(queries, ground_truth, algo_a, algo_b)
```

In this example, the `evaluate_algorithms` function would take in the search queries, the corresponding ground truth for each query, and instances of the two algorithms being compared. It would then calculate and print the average NDCG and Precision@5 for both algorithms.
