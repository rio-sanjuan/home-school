Amazon Athena is a managed, serverless, dynamically scalable distributed SQL query engine designed for fast parallel queries on extremely large datasets. Athena is based on [[Presto]], the popular open source query engine, and requires no maintenance. With Athena, we only pay for the queries we run. And we can query data in its raw form directly in our S3 data lake without additional transformations.

Amazon Athena also leverages the [[AWS Glue#Data Catalog]] to store and retrieve the schema metadata needed for our SQL queries. When we define our Athena database and tables, we point to the data location in [[Amazon S3]]. Athena then stores this table-to-S3 mapping in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. We can use [[PyAthena]], a popular open source library, to query Athena from our Python-based notebooks and scripts.
