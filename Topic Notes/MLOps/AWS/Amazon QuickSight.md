QuickSight is an easy-to-use, serverless business analytics service to quickly build powerful visualizations. We can create interactive dashboards and reports and securely share them with our coworkers via browsers or mobile devices. QuickSight already comes with an extensive library of visualizations, charts, and tables.

QuickSight implements machine learning and natural language capabilities to help us gain deeper insights from our data. Using ML Insights, we can discover hidden trends and outliers in our data. The feature also enables anyone to run what-if analysis and forecasting, without any machine learning experience needed. We can also build predictive dashboards by connecting QuickSight to our machine learning models built in [[Amazon SageMaker]].
