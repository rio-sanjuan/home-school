NFS is a protocol primarily used for file sharing in UNIX and Linux environments, allowing users to access files over a network as if they were on local storage. Works best with Linux/UNIX-based systems, but it can also be used with Windows (though less common).

Commonly used for sharing files across multiple servers in Linux-heavy environments, media streaming, and large-scale data processing.
### Features
1. Supports file sharing with high-performance and low-latency
2. Allows multiple users to work on the same files across different machines
3. Often used in cloud services (like [[Amazon EFS]]) and large enterprise networks
